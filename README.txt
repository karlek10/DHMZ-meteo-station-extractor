The script extracts time-series data from DHMZ (Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service DHMZ) table meteo-stations files (without extension).

The required functions to get the data are in the Auxiliary file. 

The extraction is done runing the extract file, where some plots are also added. More changes to come. 

All required examples, how to run the script are provided inside the script. 

The script has been written in Spyder - Python 3.7.7.

Opening the file in an editor/IDE is suggested.
